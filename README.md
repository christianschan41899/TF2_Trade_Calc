## Introduction

A Trade Value Calculator using Backpack.TF's web API.
(https://backpack.tf/developer)

This web application should allow the user to do the following:
- Create an abstract trade offer between them and another user
- Add items to each side of the trade offer, and display the total price of all items for each side of the trade.
- Display each item's individual prices in in-game currency (Refined Metal, Keys)
- Calculate the additional price added to an item with add-ons (paint, strange parts) based on a % discount.
